/**
 * GLTF RIGGING DEBUG GUIDE
 * 
 * To test if the rigging system is working:
 * 
 * 1. Load a GLB model with a humanoid rig
 * 2. Create a character
 * 3. Move joints on the stick figure
 * 4. Watch the browser console for debug messages
 * 
 * Expected console output:
 * ✅ Model has skeleton with X bones
 * ✅ Created bone mapping with X entries
 * 🎯 Applying bone rigging to character 1
 * ✅ Found exact match: LeftArm -> mixamorig:LeftArm
 * 🎯 Rotating bone mixamorig:LeftArm from leftShoulder to leftElbow
 * ✅ Rotated bone mixamorig:LeftArm toward target direction
 * 
 * If you see "❌ No bone found" messages, the bone names don't match.
 * If you see the messages but no movement, there's an issue with the skeletal animation.
